emergency replacement effort in Santa
Clara to deliver a 16-bit microprocessor in 1979. Intel gave the new team 52
weeks to develop the new “8086” ISA
and design and build the chip. Given
the tight schedule, designing the ISA
took only 10 person-weeks over three
regular calendar weeks, essentially by
extending the 8-bit registers and instruction set of the 8080 to 16 bits. The
team completed the 8086 on schedule
but to little fanfare when announced.
To Intel’s great fortune, IBM was
developing a personal computer to
compete with the Apple II and needed
a 16-bit microprocessor. IBM was interested in the Motorola 68000, which
had an ISA similar to the IBM 360, but
it was behind IBM’s aggressive schedule. IBM switched instead to an 8-bit
bus version of the 8086. When IBM announced the PC on August 12, 1981, the
hope was to sell 250,000 PCs by 1986.
The company instead sold 100 million
worldwide, bestowing a very bright future on the emergency replacement
Intel ISA.
Intel’s original 8800 project was
renamed iAPX-432 and finally announced in 1981, but it required several chips and had severe performance
problems. It was discontinued in 1986,
the year after Intel extended the 16-
bit 8086 ISA in the 80386 by expanding its registers from 16 bits to 32 bits.
Moore’s prediction was thus correct
that the next ISA would last as long as
Intel did, but the marketplace chose
the emergency replacement 8086 rather than the anointed 432. As the architects of the Motorola 68000 and iAPX432 both learned, the marketplace is
rarely patient. ","AMD and Intel used 500-person design teams and superior semiconductor technology to close the performance gap between x86 and RISC.
Again inspired by the performance
advantages of pipelining simple vs.
complex instructions, the instruction
decoder translated the complex x86
instructions into internal RISC-like
microinstructions on the fly. AMD
and Intel then pipelined the execution of the RISC microinstructions.
Any ideas RISC designers were using
for performance—separate instruction and data caches, second-level
caches on chip, deep pipelines, and
fetching and executing several instructions simultaneously—could
then be incorporated into the x86.
AMD and Intel shipped roughly 350
million x86 microprocessors annually
at the peak of the PC era in 2011. The
high volumes and low margins of the
PC industry also meant lower prices
than RISC computers.
Given the hundreds of millions
of PCs sold worldwide each year, PC
software became a giant market.
Whereas software providers for the
Unix marketplace would offer different software versions for the different commercial RISC ISAs—Alpha,
HP-PA, MIPS, Power, and SPARC—the
PC market enjoyed a single ISA, so
software developers shipped “shrink
wrap” software that was binary compatible with only the x86 ISA. A much
larger software base, similar performance, and lower prices led the x86
to dominate both desktop computers
and small-server markets by 2000.","DSAs can achieve higher performance and greater energy efficiency

They introduced separate instruction and data caches, second-level caches on chip, deep pipelines, and the ability to fetch and execute multiple instructions simultaneously. These enhancements allowed the x86 processors to achieve similar performance to RISC processors.

The x86 processors from Intel and AMD gained dominance in the PC market due to several factors. First, the high volumes and low margins of the PC industry led to lower prices for x86 computers compared to RISC computers. Additionally, the PC market enjoyed a single ISA, making it easier for software developers to create ""shrink wrap"" software that was binary compatible with the x86 ISA. The larger software base, similar performance, and lower prices of x86 computers led to their domination in both desktop and small-server markets by 2000.
","1. DSAs exploit a more efficient form of parallelism for the specific domain.
2. DSAs can make more effective use of the memory hierarchy.
3. DSAs can use less precision when it is adequate. 
4. DSAs benefit from targeting programs written in domain-specific languages (DSLs)",3.5
6430009221,"RISC architectures typically use simpler instructions that can be executed more rapidly, often in a single clock cycle. This efficiency can lead to faster overall processing times, as RISC systems can complete instructions with fewer clock cycles compared to the more complex instructions of CISC systems. The straightforward nature of RISC instructions also facilitates more efficient use of pipelining, further enhancing performance.","The 'Itanic' ISA, or Intel's Itanium architecture, became unused mainly because it was too complex and expensive, and it didn't work well with existing software. It tried to do things in a new way that required software to be specially written or adapted for it, which was hard and costly. Also, other types of computer processors, like those based on the x86 architecture, were already popular and kept getting better, making it hard for Itanium to compete. In short, it was a combination of being too complicated, not fitting in easily with what people already used, and facing tough competition from more established technologies.","The Itanium architecture, colloquially known as ""Itanic,"" fits into the MIMD (Multiple Instruction streams, Multiple Data streams) category of Flynn's Taxonomy. This classification is based on the architecture's capability to process multiple instruction streams and multiple data streams concurrently.

In MIMD architectures, each processor can execute different instructions on different pieces of data. This type of architecture is common in multi-core and multi-processor systems, where each core or processor can independently execute separate sequences of instructions on different data sets. The Itanium architecture, with its focus on parallel processing and ability to handle multiple independent threads of execution, aligns well with the MIMD classification."," Dennard scaling suggests that as transistors become smaller, they should consume less power for the same level of performance. This decrease in size allows more transistors to be packed into the same chip area, boosting performance and efficiency. For many years, Dennard scaling held true, enabling consistent improvements in the speed and power efficiency of computer processors and other electronic devices.","increasing the number of pipeline stages in a processor to boost Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) becomes impractical due to several factors. These include diminishing returns in performance gains, increased complexity in managing the pipeline, higher chances of mispredictions and pipeline hazards, and limitations in power efficiency and clock speed. Essentially, the added complexity and potential performance issues outweigh the benefits beyond a certain point.","According to Figure 5, speed up for 45-processor configuration is about 10. The percentage
of energy wasted is around 77.78 ","VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) architectures are well-suited for Domain-Specific Architectures (DSAs) because they can efficiently handle parallel processing, which is common in domain-specific tasks. The VLIW approach allows multiple operations to be executed in parallel within a single instruction cycle. Additionally, the complexity of instruction scheduling is shifted from the hardware to the compiler, which can be highly optimized for the specific computational patterns of DSAs. This leads to simpler, more energy-efficient hardware and predictable performance, making VLIW a good fit for the specialized and often performance-critical nature of DSAs.","systolic arrays are a specialized form of computing architecture designed for efficiently handling parallel data processing tasks. They consist of a network of processors that operate in a coordinated rhythm, processing and passing data sequentially between them. This setup is particularly effective for repetitive, data-intensive tasks such as those found in matrix calculations and deep learning applications. Regarding Flynn's Taxonomy, which classifies computer architectures based on instruction and data streams, systolic arrays most closely align with the SIMD (Single Instruction stream, Multiple Data streams) category. This is because they typically perform the same operation across multiple data points in parallel. However, due to their unique data flow and processing characteristics, systolic arrays are often considered a specialized form that extends beyond the traditional scope of standard SIMD architectures.","Figure 7 illustrates dramatic performance improvements in matrix multiplication when moving from native Python to optimized approaches, culminating in a massive speedup with SIMD instructions. This emphasizes the importance of optimization and hardware-aware programming.

From this, it's evident that to write more efficient software, programmers should:

1. Consider lower-level languages like C for compute-intensive tasks.
2. Exploit parallelism with techniques like parallel loops.
3. Optimize memory access patterns for better cache utilization.
4. Utilize hardware-specific features like SIMD for data processing efficiency.

In summary, Figure 7 reinforces the value of hardware-aware optimizations and could significantly shift a programmer's approach to prioritizing performance in software design.","Agile software and hardware development share key principles like iterative development, flexibility, and stakeholder collaboration, but differ in their application due to the nature of their respective mediums. Software development benefits from quicker and less expensive iterations, with changes being easier to implement and test. Hardware development, conversely, contends with longer development cycles, higher costs for prototyping and changes, and more complex physical constraints and testing requirements. While both approaches emphasize adaptability and rapid response to change, the tangible nature of hardware imposes unique challenges compared to the more fluid and malleable nature of software.","Intel's ambitious 8800 project, planned to be a highly advanced ISA, failed primarily due to its complexity, development delays, and performance issues. It was a technologically advanced concept but proved too complex and costly to be practical. The delays and challenges faced by the 8800 led Intel to develop the 8086 as an emergency replacement. The 8086 was a simpler, more practical processor that extended Intel's existing 8-bit architecture to 16 bits. Its development was rapid and successful, striking a balance between performance, cost, and compatibility. The 8086 gained widespread adoption, especially after being chosen by IBM for its first Personal Computer, setting the standard for the PC industry. This success cemented the 8086, and its subsequent x86 architecture, as the dominant standard in personal computing, effectively replacing the 8800 project.","Intel and AMD improved the performance of x86 ISA, a CISC architecture, and helped it regain dominance in the PC market through several key innovations. They incorporated advanced pipelining and superscalar technologies for simultaneous instruction processing, and implemented out-of-order execution and sophisticated branch prediction for more efficient instruction handling. Micro-op translation was a critical improvement, converting complex x86 instructions into simpler operations, merging CISC compatibility with RISC-like efficiency. Enhancements in cache design, the introduction of multicore processors, and integration of advanced features like hardware virtualization and multimedia instruction sets also played significant roles. A crucial factor in the success of the x86 architecture was its extensive, established software ecosystem, ensuring compatibility with a wide range of applications, which was particularly appealing in the consumer and business markets. These advancements collectively enhanced the performance and appeal of x86-based systems, enabling them to compete effectively with RISC-based architectures.","Domain-Specific Architectures (DSAs) achieve higher performance and greater energy efficiency primarily due to their specialized design, which is tailored for specific types of tasks. This specialization allows DSAs to execute relevant operations more efficiently than general-purpose processors. They optimize parallelism for their target domain, use streamlined instruction sets, have custom memory hierarchies suited to their specific data access patterns, and often utilize lower-precision arithmetic where appropriate. All these factors contribute to making DSAs more efficient and faster for their specific applications, while also reducing power consumption.",4.0
